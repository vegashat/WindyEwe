## Hand Woven Alpaca Scarf

This is absolutely my favorite weaving project so far. I love the colors and the way they stripe. I recently listed this [one](https://www.etsy.com/listing/292941233/striped-hand-woven-alpaca-scarf?ref=shop_home_active_1 "Striped Alpaca Scarf") on my [shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/WindyEwe?ref=l2-shopheader-name "shop link").

We did a photo shoot last weekend and I think the pictures came out really well. We still need a little more practice but over I'm very pleased.

This scarf was woven with an alpaca blend yarn that was self striping. I used my Cricket loom and an 8 dent reed. The yarn is worsted weight. I made it super long and love the length.
